pyglame
=======

pyglame provides an object-orientated programming interface that closely follows
pyglet. It runs on top of pygame, giving you access to pyglets excellent
app/window/clock/resource framework.


It is pronounced pig-lame, it is a combination of pyglet and pygame.


I cannot stress this enough that it does not support OpenGL at all at the
moment, and I have little motivation to do so. Unless someone can give me a
compelling argument, use pyglet if you really need opengl?
